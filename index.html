            The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 
            It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, 
            while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. 
            A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, 
            by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.

            The guitar is classified as a chordophone â€“ 
            meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points. 
            Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut.
            Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States; nylon strings came in the 1940s.

        <!-- This was used to anchor the section to allow the background rectangle to look normal
        the background colour within the section would always end at the bottom of the final attribute 
        due to me having to force the text and the image to be on the same level, the background would always look like its not aligned correctly. 
        so i added this small invisible line of text to force the background to be underneath this line. Looking at the website you cant tell this is here however it fixes a large problem -->

            The piano is a stringed keyboard instrument in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). 
            It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings. 
            It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.

            The word "piano" is a shortened form of pianoforte, the Italian term for the early 1700s versions of the instrument, which in turn derives from clavicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano. 
            The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate "soft" and "loud" respectively,
            in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist's touch or pressure on the keys: 
            the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings, and the louder the sound of the note produced and the stronger the attack. 
            The first fortepianos in the 1700s allowed for a quieter sound and greater dynamic range than the harpsichord.

            The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone in the violin family. 
            Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings, 
            usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers 
            and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow.

            Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. 
            They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles and as solo instruments. 
            Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. 
            Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion.
